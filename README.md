# SAM
## how to use SAM

SAM is a super segmentation model developed by Meta AI, is a foundation model designed for promot-based and interactive image segmentation. It can generate high-quality segmentation masks for a wide range of objects using simple user inputs such as points, bounding boxes, or storkes. SAM was trained on the large-scale SA-1B dataset consisting of 11 million images and 1 billion masks.

Although SAM can rapidly generate segmentation masks for general images, it still faces significant challenges when appiled to medical imaging, especially in detecting subtle or micro-calcifications.

The code demonstrates how to run the SAM API on Google Colab and shows that a single click is sufficient to interactively produce an accurate segmentation mask of the target object.
